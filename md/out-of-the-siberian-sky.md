i touched the computer laying on the bedside table

I could almost feel it's gentle throbbing

I imagined it's the script working tirelessly corrupting all files

I knew she was very much alive

and I knew all the possible paths she could take

first the log files

network settings

neural enviros

system set-up files

and then she will hit the core

making herself immune to all I could possibly find to prevent the corruption

I was wondering if it's all over

if I could salvage and rescue anything from that I had left

I knew the answer all too well

I'm a fool

falling

burned

out of the siberian sky
