JC twisted his arm and looked closer at the perforation. then he look up again, smiled and chewing his apple said grinning 

it's illegal isn't it?

yes... how did you know?

I'm a pro my man. what's with the upgrades? how do you handle it?

well I have a plan in place...

how long till you'll be able to get off the drugs?

fifteen months

I looked at him

shit, that's a long time.

JC slapped my shoulder and showing me all his teeth said

yes my organic friend it is a very very long time.

the kid looked at me curiously 

you are organic? wow I was always wondering how do you people do this? I mean how do you connect without a direct link?

I looked away

it's easy i light up some candles, smoke dope, play bongos and do some chanting until I get online...

JC chuckled  

funny man isn't he? this organic friend of mine. but for real this is exactly how he does it.

seriously? is that what you do?

no not really... only when I feel particularly suicidal. so where are you planning to get the drugs from?

well this is why I came to you... I was given your hash from james ... the guy from the city airport projects...

JC was still examining the implant and looked up, bit off a huge chunk of his apple and munching it loudly smiled

that's good my man. you did well ... but you do know this expensive gear of yours is a very thirsty one, don't you?

yeah but I'm kind of prepared ... I mean for the costs and I hope to get back some of the investment as soon as I get to the surface

well don't count on it though. you don't want to end up as most expensive piece of used-up hardware on the other side of the river do you? trust me. I've seen people going that route and it is a risky business.

I know but I'm cool for half a year which I am happy to pay up front if you can get me what I need and secure it for me in a deposit downtown.

yes my man I can get you what you need and I will get the six months for you by the end of the week. we will talk money tomorrow. I'll call you before I set up the arrangement for your treatment.

I looked at the matt finish of the implant. I wonder where he got this kind of money?
