so why did you quit

it made no sense to do it anymore. some surgeries became so cheap it became the art for those with money. not very nice people there.

this is less artistic but still fun?

and money.

true. so what are we talking about.

take a look at this stuff here. I have a call... what's up my man?

that's it! you've got the idea... yeah... but you don't want to go for the cheap one. trust me. you need 5k to start with. we'll get you the core set and start modifications... no, you don't set up the whole stack at the beginning. by the time you have the components you'll change your stack several times... yes it will take good month... don't worry papa will keep fingers on the tabs... he he... let's meet up in few days and you will show me the area you mentioned before and we set up the details for your purchases... okay we'll talk later... yeah... okay I got to go. talk later.

right so where do we start? which is the one I want?

well...

the top one.

he he yeah! no but really you can start off with the third procedure...
