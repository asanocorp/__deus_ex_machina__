it's such a pleasant and quiet evening. very hot after hot day but now I can feel chilling breeze cutting through the dense air.

the storm seems just moments away but it might as well not come at all.

and here comes the rain.

back inside there is a cat waiting for me and an empty bed.

tea. cigarette. silence.

I feel almost at peace and happy.

I will lay down in bed in a moment trying to fall asleep. thinking about all the work I haven't done today. 

I don't know where you are and what bed you are sleeping in tonight. and I'm slowly learning how not to care anymore.

I still remember though the other night.

the sad song you sang 

your words that you love me.

and the sex

I know it was true I feel the same.

and it wasn't just sex.

the wind is making pictures fall off the walls making me feel even more alone

thinking of a body of another human next to mine

and how much I want it.

it makes me sad to think I have no other choice but to start looking for someone like you

to replace you.

even though I don't want to.
